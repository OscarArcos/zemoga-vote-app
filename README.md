##### Created by Oscar Arcos üë®‚Äçüíª

### Overview
This test is based on [Zemoga Front End Development - Candidate Test v2.1](https://github.com/zemoga/ui-test "Zemoga Front End Development - Candidate Test v2.1") in order to show my skills as a front end developer to apply for the vacancy. The project has 2 main modules, (The [Back end](https://github.com/OscarArcos/ZemogaFrontTest/tree/master/Zemoga-back "Back end") and the [Front end](https://github.com/OscarArcos/ZemogaFrontTest/tree/master/Zemoga-prueba-tecnica "Front end")).

**Back end** üöÄ

The backend is a REST API fed with the [information of the people provided by Zemoga](https://github.com/zemoga/ui-test/blob/master/assets/data.json "information of the people provided by Zemoga"). It is built with Node.js, MongoDB and express to have data persistence.

To access the back end files directory run the command

`cd Zemoga-back`

**Front end** üíª

The front end is built with [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/ "Nuxt.js") which is a Vue.js framework that helps us and make it easy the management of data states and more specs. Also, the css preprocessor called sass is being used for the main html styles.
